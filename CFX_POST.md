### 7 Armor Sets (70 Pieces)

| Set | Specialization | Key Stats |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| Wolf Hunter | Animal defense | 65% Animal Resist, Cold Resist, Stealth |

- **2 pieces**: Minor stat bonus
- **4 pieces**: Moderate bonus
- **6 pieces**: Strong bonus
- **8 pieces**: Major bonus
- **10 pieces**: Full set bonus + **unique passive ability**

### Unique Passive Abilities (10-Piece Bonuses)

| Set | Passive | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Wolf Hunter | Wolf Detection Reduction | NPCs have drastically reduced awareness of you |
| Bear Barbarian | Bear Charge Resistance | Immune to ragdoll effects |
| Outlaw Duster | Bullet Dodge Chance | 15% chance to completely negate bullet damage |
| Mystic Scholar | Enemy Detection Boost | Blips appear on hostile/alert NPCs nearby |
| Snake Oil Salesman | Poison Aura | Deals AoE poison damage to nearby NPCs |
| Night Stalker | Assassination Expertise | Bonus stealth + extra damage on unaware NPCs |
| Wild West Legend | Quickdraw Mastery | 2x intimidation effect + passive deadeye recovery |

### Damage Reduction
- **Formula**: `reduction% = (armorBase x multiplier) + categoryResist`
- Capped at configurable maximum (default 65%)
- Categories: Bullet, Melee, Animal, Fall, Explosion, Poison
- Damage is **reduced**, not absorbed - your health still goes down, but less

### Durability & Wear
- Taking damage reduces armor piece condition
- Wear spreads to nearby slots (torso hit also wears belt/amulet)
- When condition reaches 0, the piece **breaks** and is removed
- Condition is saved per-item via metadata

### Movement & Speed
- Heavier armor slows you down (weight penalty per piece)
- `staminaCostModifier` affects movement speed
- Configurable min/max speed multipliers

### Environmental Effects
- **Cold/Heat Resistance**: Reduces core drain in extreme temperatures
- **Stamina/Deadeye Drain**: Armor modifies core drain rates
- **Stealth/Noise**: Reduces NPC hearing and seeing range
- **Intimidation**: Chance to make aimed NPCs surrender with hands up

### Crafting System
- **Blacksmith NPC stations** at configurable locations (default: Valentine, Annesburg, Rhodes)
- NPCs with proper outfit spawns and idle animations
- **3-layer menu**: Set Selection > Piece List > Confirm/Craft
- Progress bar with animation during crafting
- 14 crafting materials included

### In-Game HUD
- Bottom-left HUD showing equipped armor pieces with condition bars
- Auto-hides when no armor is equipped
- Clean, minimal design matching RDR2 aesthetics
